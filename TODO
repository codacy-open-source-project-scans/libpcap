 TODO list for libpcap
=======================

Less urgent items
-----------------

- Better documentation and cleanup of the interface. I am seeing a few
  problems at the first glance which needs fixing:
  + not very well suited for interactive programs (think Wireshark). There
    should be a way for the application to get a file descriptor which it
    has to monitor and a callback in pcap which has to be called on
    activity (XXX - "pcap_get_selectable_fd()" handles the first part -
    although "select()" and "poll()" don't work on BPF devices on some
    BSDs and don't work on older versions of other BSDs - and you can
    call "pcap_dispatch()" as the dispatch routine after putting the
    descriptor into non-blocking mode)
